1. Travel Plan Web Application: 

Design a web application for users to select preferences of different categories (attractions, restaurants, hotels) and users can receive a travel plan. The APIs we can use are Google, Yelp, Amadeus place APIs to get the data sets of attractions, restaurants, and hotels. The travel plan is generated by the recommendation system based on users' preferences, ratings, and locations (lat, lon).
  APIs/Datasets:
   > https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview - Google place APIs
   > https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started - Yelp APIs
   > https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/covid-19-and-travel-safety/api-doc/safe-place/api-reference - Amadeus place APIs

2. Boston Delivery Management System Web Application: 

Design a drone & robot delivery management system. We have a few bases in Boston to send out drone & robot to delivery package. Users can type their name pickup address, recevier's name and delivery address to create order in the order interface. The recommendation system generate delivery plans based on users' inputs in the plan interface. Users can also register for an account and login/logout to review their delivery status. Use Google Geolocation API or Pubnub to visualize the delivery status on the Google Map.
  APIs/Datasets: Google API(text search)/Pakage delivery time/Google Geolocation API

3. Util:

Many people, myself included, have issues tracking recurring payments. Some of the largest of these payments are utility bills, such as monthly AC, electric, or water bills. This app will help users track their bills: when they recur, how much they pay, and how their payments stack up versus nearby payments/providers. Users can register for accounts for a streamlined dashboard, where their bills pop up in the order they're due.

4. Solar:

This app will allow citizens to see how much they could save, monetarily & energy-wise, by switching to solar power. Users can login to their utility provider (Coned, PECO) using the utilityapi and we can query which utilities they're looking to "solarize" according to subsequent form data. The form will also include details about their household: address, number of residents, avg utility costs, etc. From there, we can see how much energy solar solutions would generate according to the solcast API, which forecasts data for irradiance and PV power. The formula E = A x r x H x PR (Read more at: https://www.saurenergy.com/solar-energy-blog/here-is-how-you-can-calculate-the-annual-solar-energy-output-of-a-photovoltaic-system) will yield the kWh, which we can compare to the kWh from utilityapi. We will also show state solar tax incentives using this database (https://www.dsireusa.org/resources/data-and-tools/). Users can also see if their community offers community solar solutions by querying this database(https://data.nrel.gov/submissions/149). This will allow both low-income and hesitant users to get involved in solar, perhaps if they're not ready to fully commit or dont have the means to implement solar solutions fully.


to consider:
